# Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** project! This repository contains code, data, and documentation for building, evaluating, and interpreting machine learning models to predict customer churn. The goal is to identify which customers are likely to leave a company's service, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Project Overview

Customer retention is crucial for business growth. Predicting customer churn helps companies focus their marketing and service efforts on at-risk customers. In this project, we apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to classify customers as "churn" or "not churn" based on historical data.

---

## Business Problem

- **Objective:** Predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) in the near future.
- **Benefits:** Early identification of at-risk customers enables targeted retention campaigns, reducing revenue loss and improving customer satisfaction.

## Dataset Description

- **Source:** (Please specify if public or proprietary)
- **Features:** Typical columns include:
  - `customerID`: Unique customer identifier
  - `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`: Demographic information
  - `tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed
  - `PhoneService`, `InternetService`, etc.: Service-related features
  - `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`: Billing information
  - `Churn`: Target variable (Yes/No)
- **Shape:** _n_ rows × _m_ columns

---

## Data Analysis & Visualization

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Distribution of churn vs. non-churn
   - Correlation between features and churn
   - Customer demographics and service usage patterns

2. **Visualizations:**
   - Bar plots, histograms, box plots for numerical and categorical features
   - Heatmaps for feature correlations
   - Churn rate by feature (e.g., tenure, contract type)

---

## Feature Engineering

- Handling missing values and outliers
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalization/standardization
- Creating derived features (e.g., average monthly spend)

---

## Model Building

- **Algorithms Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
- **Pipeline:**
  - Train-test split
  - Model training
  - Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV or similar)
  - Cross-validation

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**
- **Confusion Matrix**

---

## Results

- Best-performing model and its metrics
- Feature importance analysis
- Interpretation of key drivers of churn

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mohamednowfil/Customer-Churn-Prediction-.git
    cd Customer-Churn-Prediction-
    ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run analysis:**
    - Jupyter Notebook: Open and run `Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb`
    - Python script: Run `python main.py` (if available)
4. **Prediction:**
    - Replace sample input in `predict.py` or notebook with your own data to get churn predictions.
